Challenge: SkipTheDishes - Skip the Dishes

Name: Sylvio Antonio Pedroza Neto

### Project Title ###
Customer api for food advertising.
I created a micro service that can be used for mobile and desktop clients in order to get customer information.
Advertising apps can invoke these APIs to find potential customers based on zip code or geo position, and send them promotions or other advertising goals. 
For instance, a restaurant would like to see all customers placed in a specific zip code where people don’t order food very often in order to offer them a discount.
Or, a new restaurant want to know who leaves in the neighborhood and offer a promotional price in its opening week.
