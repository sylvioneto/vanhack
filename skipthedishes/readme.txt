I created a set of services that can be used for mobile and desktop clients in order to get customer information.

Restaurant app can invoke these APIs to find potential customers based on zip code or geo position for example and send them promotions or other advertising goals. For example:

Example 1: I would like to see all customers placed in a specific zip code where people donâ€™t order food very often in order to offer them a discount. 
Example 2: I would like to see all customers in the shopping mall (given shopping geo location) and invite them to go to a restaurant for a special bonus.
